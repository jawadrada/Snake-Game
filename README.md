# Snake-Game

## **Overview**
This project features a Snake Game where the player controls a green-colored snake with a predefined number of body segments. The player can move the snake in four directions: left, right, up, and down. The game ends if the snake collides with the game area's outer boundaries or if the snake's head hits its own body. The objective of the game is to collect as many apples as possible, which appear randomly across the playing field. Each apple collected causes the snake to grow in size.

### **Technolgy Required**
This project requires the Java programming language. Additionally, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) capable of compiling and running Java code is needed.
